 Simple Radio Native Application

I wanted to learn a bit about native android apps and this is what came to my head as an idea to do. It has really simple but frendly radio interface that uses Async android media player to play streamed radio stations. 

Two more things are planned for a near future 
1. Implementing search option. Only the layout is done at the moment.
2. Adding a Record function

# ZeDio-Android-Radio

<p><i>Forget about the problem with YouTube that stop playing while in a background, forget about all anoying adverts, forget about paid services... all we want is to listem and possibly record our favourite radios.</i></p>

It has really simple but frendly user interface and uses the build in media player asynchronously to play radio stations. Record and search options are just some good additions that make the app more useful.

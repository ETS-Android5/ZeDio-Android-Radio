 Simple Radio Native Application

I wanted to learn a bit about native android apps and this is what came to my head as an idea to do. It has really simple but has frendly user interface and uses the build in media player asynchronous to play streamed radio stations. Record and search options are just some good additions that can make the app more useful.

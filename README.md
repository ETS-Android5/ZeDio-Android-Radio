 Simple Radio Native Application

I wanted to learn a bit about native android apps and this is what came to my head as an idea to do. It has really simple but frendly user interface and uses the build in media player asynchronous to play streamed radio stations.

Features:
        - Search radio by name, genre and country

In proggress:
        - Record fuctionality
